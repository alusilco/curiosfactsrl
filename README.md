# Curious Facts API

## 🕯️ Project context

The Useless Facts company wants to develop the front-end part of an application that returns curious facts that nobody cares about, the idea is that within the main page, we can see each curious fact that the https://uselessfacts API returns. jsph.pl/ and if we like a curious fact, we can save it within a favorite space on the same main page.
